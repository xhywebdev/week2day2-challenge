    <h1>Challenge 2:<br> CSS Positioning</h1>

    <h2>Farm Animals</h2>
    <p>This challenge lab is full of fun surprises related to static, relative, absolute and fixed positioning and z-index! There are also cute little animals to admire.</p>
    
    <img src="images/pig.png" width="297px" height="196px" alt="a cute little pig is smiling at you!">

    <p>Pigs are quite cute. I cut and paste lorem ipsum text so frequently that it's hard for me to think of anything to actually write off of the top of my head. Pigs make bacon. If you're vegetarian, veggie bacon isn't at all like the real thing.</p>
    
    <img src="images/cow.png" width="297px" height="199px" alt="this cow doesn't look very happy">

    <p>The cows in the image don't look very happy. I wonder what they're so upset about. Maybe they just don't like being in pictures. </p>
